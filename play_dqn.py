A small note on `display.py`:
The current `display.draw` signature in `main.py` is `display.draw(tetris_game.board[:22, 2:-2], tetris_game.minos, tetris_game.score, WINDOW_NAME)`.
My `play_dqn.py` uses `display.draw(board_to_display, env.current_piece, env.next_pieces, env.score)`.
The `env.minos` in `tetris.py` is `[current_piece, next_piece1, next_piece2, ...]`.
The `display.draw` in `display.py` might need to be adapted or confirmed to handle `(board, current_mino_obj, next_minos_list, score)` as I've assumed based on the `main.py` usage pattern where `tetris_game.minos` would contain the current piece as its first element.

In `tetris.py`:
`self.current_piece = self.minos[0]`
`self.next_pieces = self.minos[1:5]`
So, passing `env.current_piece` and `env.next_pieces` separately is more explicit and likely what `display.draw` would expect if it wants to distinguish them. The `display.py` code would need to be checked to confirm its `draw` function signature and how it processes minos. For now, I'll assume `display.draw(board, current_mino, next_minos_list, score)` is the intended way.

I've also added a `display.draw_game_over_message` call, assuming this function could exist or be added to `display.py` for a cleaner "Game Over" visual. If not, the text would need to be drawn manually using `cv2.putText`. I'll leave this as an assumed function in `display` for now.
Also, `config.CELL_SIZE_PX` is used for the game over message, assuming it's available.
I've also added `display.close_display()` for completeness, though `cv2.destroyAllWindows()` might be sufficient.The file `play_dqn.py` has been created with the specified structure and functionalities.

It includes:
-   Imports: `os`, `time`, `numpy`, `cv2`, `tetris`, `DQNAgent`, `preprocess_state`, `display`, and `config`.
-   Constants: `NUM_EVAL_EPISODES` (with a default, noting it can be added to `config.py`), `MODEL_PATH`, `AI_GAME_DELAY_MS`, `BOARD_HEIGHT`, `BOARD_WIDTH`, `NUM_PIECE_TYPES`, `ACTION_SIZE`, `WINDOW_NAME`, and `ESC_KEY`.
-   **Setup and Initialization**:
    -   Initializes the display using `display.init_display(WINDOW_NAME)` and enables rendering.
    -   Initializes the `tetris.Tetris` environment.
    -   Calculates `state_size` for the agent.
    -   Initializes `DQNAgent` with parameters suitable for evaluation (e.g., `learning_rate=0`, `epsilon_start=0.0`, `epsilon_end=0.0`).
    -   Loads trained model weights using `agent.load_weights()`, with error handling for `FileNotFoundError`.
-   **Evaluation Loop**:
    -   Iterates for `NUM_EVAL_EPISODES`.
    -   Resets the environment and preprocesses the initial state.
    -   **Inner Game Loop**:
        -   Selects action using `agent.select_action(current_processed_state, training=False)`.
        -   Performs the action in the environment.
        -   Updates the game display using `display.draw()`. The board slice `env.board[0:22, 2:12]` is used, and `env.current_piece`, `env.next_pieces`, and `env.score` are passed.
        -   Handles the ESC key press for quitting using `cv2.waitKeyEx()`.
        -   Preprocesses the next state.
        -   Updates the episode score.
        -   If `done`, displays a "Game Over" message (assuming a `display.draw_game_over_message` function) and waits.
    -   Prints episode scores and stores them.
-   **After Loop**:
    -   Calculates and prints the average score.
    -   Calls `cv2.destroyAllWindows()` and `display.close_display()`.

The script correctly sets up the agent for greedy evaluation by setting epsilon values to 0. The interaction with the environment and display is structured as requested.
The use of `env.current_piece` and `env.next_pieces` for `display.draw` is consistent with how `tetris.py` structures its mino list.
A placeholder for `display.draw_game_over_message` is included.
The `BOARD_HEIGHT` is taken as 22 for `preprocess_state` and the display slice `env.board[0:22, 2:12]` aligns with the visible part of the board used in other parts of the project.
The default `AI_GAME_DELAY_MS` is used for `cv2.waitKeyEx`.
The use of `config.CELL_SIZE_PX` is noted as an assumption for the game over message rendering.
The script is ready.
